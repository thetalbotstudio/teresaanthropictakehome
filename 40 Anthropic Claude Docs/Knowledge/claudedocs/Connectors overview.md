Connectors extend Claude’s capabilities by connecting it to external tools and data sources. They are powered by the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/mcp), an open standard created by Anthropic that provides a unified way for AI applications to interact with the outside world.

## How connectors work

Connectors can do two things:

- **Provide tools and information** — Give Claude access to external data and the ability to take actions (search files, read emails, create issues, etc.)
- **Surface UI components** — Render interactive visual elements directly in the conversation through [MCP Apps](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/mcp-apps/getting-started)

**Building for Claude?** Most partners ship both a remote MCP server and a plugin that wraps it with skills. See [what to build](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/what-to-build) for the decision guide.

## Types of connectors

### Prebuilt integrations

Anthropic provides first-party integrations with popular services like Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, GitHub, Slack, and Microsoft 365. These are ready to use with no setup beyond authentication. See [Getting started](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/getting-started) for setup instructions.

### Remote MCP servers

[Remote MCP servers](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/custom/remote-mcp) communicate with Claude over the internet, giving it access to cloud-hosted tools and data. You can connect to existing remote MCP servers or build your own for any tool or service.

### MCP Apps

[MCP Apps](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/mcp-apps/getting-started) allow MCP servers to display interactive UI elements in conversational MCP clients. Rather than only returning text, an MCP App can render charts, maps, forms, and other visual components directly in the chat. See the [design guidelines](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/mcp-apps/design-guidelines) and [cross-platform compatibility](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/mcp-apps/cross-compatibility) docs for building MCP Apps.

### MCP Bundles

[MCP Bundles (MCPB)](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/custom/desktop-extensions) package MCP servers with their dependencies for distribution as desktop extensions. MCPB handles cross-platform compatibility, dependency management, code signing, and centralized version updates — making it suitable for enterprise deployment of local MCP servers to Claude Desktop.

### Self-serve local MCP

Local MCP servers distributed through third-party package registries like npm or PyPI cannot be listed directly in the Connectors Directory. To distribute a local server, package it as an [MCPB](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/mcpb) for the Desktop Extensions gallery, or bundle it in a [plugin](https://claude.com/docs/plugins/overview) using `.mcp.json` and submit it to the [plugin directory](https://claude.com/docs/plugins/submit).

## Ways to connect

### Connectors directory

The [Connectors Directory](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/directory) is an open catalog of MCP servers from Anthropic and third-party developers, available across all Claude products. It includes both connectors that Anthropic has verified and community connectors; see [connector verification](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/verification) to learn what each label means.

### Third-party connectors

You can build and connect your own MCP servers for proprietary tools or workflows. See [Third-party Connectors](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/custom/remote-mcp) for remote MCP and [Desktop Extensions](https://claude.com/docs/connectors/custom/desktop-extensions) for local integrations.

## Related concepts

### Plugins

[Plugins](https://claude.com/docs/plugins/overview) combine MCP connectors, [Skills](https://claude.com/docs/skills/overview), slash commands, and sub-agents into shareable capability packages. They are available in Claude Code and Cowork. You can also [submit your plugin](https://claude.com/docs/plugins/submit) to the plugin directory.
