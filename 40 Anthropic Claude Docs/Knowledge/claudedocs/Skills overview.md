Skills are directories containing instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude dynamically loads to handle specific tasks. Each skill has a `SKILL.md` file that defines when it should be activated and what instructions Claude should follow.

## Availability

Skills are available for users on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. The Skills feature requires code execution to be enabled.

## How skills work

Skills use progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently:

1. **Metadata loading**: Claude reads skill names and descriptions at startup (~100 tokens each)
2. **Activation**: When a task matches a skill’s description, Claude loads the full `SKILL.md` content
3. **Resource loading**: Additional files (scripts, references) are loaded only when needed

This approach prevents context window overload while providing specialized capabilities on demand.

## Types of skills

- **Anthropic skills**: Pre-built skills for document creation (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, PDF) that activate automatically when relevant.
- **Partner skills**: Skills from partners like Notion, Figma, and Atlassian designed for seamless MCP connector integration.
- **Organization-provisioned skills**: Skills deployed organization-wide by Team and Enterprise administrators.
- **Custom skills**: Skills you create for specialized workflows—generating emails, applying brand guidelines, integrating with tools like JIRA or Linear, and more!

## Skills vs. other features

| Feature | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Skills** | Task-specific procedures that load dynamically |
| **[Plugins](https://claude.com/docs/plugins/overview)** | Shareable packages that bundle skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents |
| **Projects** | Static background knowledge always loaded in specific chats |
| **MCP** | Connects Claude to external services |
| **Custom Instructions** | Broad preferences applied to all conversations |

## Open standard

Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification), a platform-agnostic standard. Skills you create can work across any platform adopting the standard.

See [Creating custom skills](https://claude.com/docs/skills/how-to) to learn how to build your own, or bundle skills into [plugins](https://claude.com/docs/plugins/overview) to share them with your team.
